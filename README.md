This is a simple FDTD simulation on electromagnetic waves in both 1D and 2D. The code is comprised of 3 separate files, 1 for 1D, another for the 2D and an animation specific file. The final 2D FDTD code has implementations of a Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) and a Total Field Scattered Field (TFSF) region. The 5 mp4s show the different characteristics that planar and pulse like waves do when they interact with Perfect Electrical Conductors (PECs) and Dieletric materials with a set EPSR.
